I am building a chat app let's finish it today.

when you put flags(-y,-D)it is to tell something to the terminal

-D this is used to tell the terminal that the module will be used as dev dependency

.. - means go one folder up 
. - means current directory 


always use try catch becuz It is best practice and it is helpful to catch errors without breaking any code 


//production

you need to have the same configurations as that of package.json in backend


{
  "name": "project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend && npm run build --prefix frontend",
    "start": "npm run start --prefix backend"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "type": "commonjs"
}


the scripts here will run the backend and frontend by building the node modules and start will run the backend 

steps of creating project
create frontend and backend then  
make models, make the api endpoints and routes along with middleware
then make the controllers(functionalities when the endpoint hits) 


after this create the routes in frontend and make the files manageable

using axios rather then fetch because it is a lot more convenient
